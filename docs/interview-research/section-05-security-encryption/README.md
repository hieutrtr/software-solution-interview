## Section-Wide Concepts

### Fundamental Principles
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify approach to security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and systems
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Security by Design**: Incorporating security from the beginning of development
- **Risk-Based Security**: Prioritizing security measures based on risk assessment

### Common Technologies/Frameworks
- **OWASP**: Top 10, ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard), SAMM
- **Cryptographic Libraries**: TLS, AES, RSA, ECDSA, bcrypt, Argon2
- **Identity Providers**: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, JWT
- **Security Tools**: Static analysis (SonarQube, Checkmarx), dynamic analysis (OWASP ZAP)
- **Certificate Management**: Let's Encrypt, AWS Certificate Manager, HashiCorp Vault

### Industry Context
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS requirements
- **Modern Threats**: Supply chain attacks, zero-day exploits, AI-powered attacks
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Security integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- **Cloud Security Models**: Shared responsibility, cloud-native security services

## Cross-Section Connections

### Dependencies
- **From Section 1**: Clean code principles enable secure code reviews and maintenance
- **From Section 2**: CAP theorem considerations affect security architecture decisions
- **From Section 3**: Interface patterns determine security boundaries and controls

### Leads Into
- **Section 4**: Service mesh provides infrastructure for many security patterns (mTLS, identity)
- **Section 6**: AWS-specific implementations of general security principles
- **Section 8**: Architecture design must incorporate security from the ground up

## Preparation Strategy

### Study Sequence
1. **Start with OWASP Top 10 2021** - fundamental vulnerabilities and mitigations
2. **Build understanding of cryptographic primitives** - encryption, hashing, signing
3. **Master authentication and authorization patterns** - OAuth, RBAC, ABAC
4. **Learn threat modeling methodologies** - STRIDE, PASTA, attack trees
5. **Practice with real implementations** - mTLS setup, secure coding examples

### Practice Recommendations
- **Set up mTLS** between two services to understand certificate management
- **Implement JWT authentication** with proper validation and refresh token handling
- **Conduct threat modeling** exercise on a sample application architecture
- **Review real security incidents** and their architectural implications
- **Practice secure code reviews** using OWASP guidelines

## Common Interview Patterns

### Typical Question Flow
1. **Foundational Knowledge**: OWASP categories and basic security principles
2. **Implementation Experience**: "Tell me about a time you implemented..."
3. **Trade-off Decisions**: Security vs performance/usability considerations
4. **Incident Response**: How to handle security issues discovered late
5. **Future Planning**: Staying current with evolving security landscape

### Follow-up Themes
- **Specific Implementation Details**: "How exactly did you configure..."
- **Scale Considerations**: "How does this work with thousands of services..."
- **Compliance Requirements**: "How do you ensure this meets SOX/GDPR..."
- **Team Adoption**: "How did you get developers to follow these practices..."

### Red Flags to Avoid
- **Security as Afterthought**: Don't present security as something added later
- **Overly Complex Solutions**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated security measures
- **Theoretical Only**: Must have practical implementation experience
- **Ignoring Performance**: Don't dismiss performance impacts of security measures
- **Static Knowledge**: Must show awareness of evolving threat landscape
