# Securing API Gateway Endpoints for Frontend Applications

## Original Question
> **How do you secure API Gateway endpoints for frontend applications?**

## Core Concepts

### Key Definitions
- **API Gateway**: An AWS managed service that allows developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- **Cognito User Pools**: A fully managed user directory service that provides sign-up and sign-in options for web and mobile applications.
- **Lambda Authorizer**: An API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API methods, typically by validating a bearer token like a JWT.
- **AWS WAF**: A web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. It needs to be configured on API Gateway to allow legitimate frontend applications to call the API.

### Fundamental Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Applying multiple layers of security controls is more effective than relying on a single point of protection. For API Gateway, this means combining network controls, traffic filtering, and request authorization.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Modern web applications, especially SPAs, should use a token-based pattern (e.g., OIDC/OAuth 2.0) to avoid storing any secrets or credentials on the client-side.
- **Least Privilege**: API endpoints should only be accessible by authenticated and authorized clients with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

## Best Practices & Industry Standards

### Recognized Patterns

#### 1. **Authentication with Amazon Cognito**
- **Description**: The most common and recommended pattern for applications with end-users. Cognito handles the entire user lifecycle (registration, sign-in, password reset) and provides JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to the authenticated frontend application.
- **Implementation**: Configure a `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer on your API Gateway methods. The frontend application includes the ID or Access Token from Cognito in the `Authorization` header of every request. API Gateway automatically validates the token's signature, expiration, and claims before invoking the backend.

#### 2. **Custom Authentication with Lambda Authorizers**
- **Description**: Used when you need custom authentication logic, such as integrating with a third-party identity provider or using a custom token format.
- **Implementation**: A Lambda function is triggered for incoming requests. It receives the request context (including headers), validates the token, and returns an IAM policy document that either allows or denies the request. The policy can be cached for a configurable TTL to improve performance.

#### 3. **Traffic Filtering with AWS WAF**
- **Description**: A critical first line of defense against common web attacks and malicious traffic.
- **Implementation**: Associate a WAF Web ACL (Access Control List) with the API Gateway stage. Use AWS Managed Rule Sets to get immediate protection against threats like SQL injection, XSS, and known bad bots. Add custom and rate-based rules to mitigate application-specific threats and DDoS attacks.

#### 4. **Network Isolation with Resource Policies and VPC Endpoints**
- **Description**: For internal APIs or those that should not be exposed to the public internet, this pattern provides network-level isolation.
- **Implementation**: Create a `Private` API Gateway endpoint. Access is then controlled via a resource policy that can, for example, restrict invocations to principals and resources within a specific VPC or from a specific source IP range.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Public-Facing E-commerce SPA
**Context**: An e-commerce Single-Page Application (SPA) hosted on S3/CloudFront needs to call backend APIs for product catalogs, user profiles, and order processing.
**Challenge**: Securely manage user authentication and protect the API from common web threats.
**Solution**:
1.  **Authentication**: Used an Amazon Cognito User Pool to manage all customer identities. The SPA uses the AWS Amplify library to handle the sign-in flow, which returns JWTs to the client.
2.  **Authorization**: API Gateway was configured with a Cognito authorizer. All API calls from the SPA include the JWT in the `Authorization` header. API Gateway validates the token before passing the request to the backend Lambda functions.
3.  **Firewall**: An AWS WAF Web ACL was attached to the API Gateway stage, using AWS Managed Rules for SQLi and XSS, plus a rate-based rule to prevent brute-force login attempts.
**Outcome**: A highly secure and scalable authentication system was created with minimal custom code. The WAF blocked thousands of automated scanning attempts in the first week.
**Technologies**: API Gateway, AWS Cognito, AWS WAF, AWS Lambda, AWS Amplify.

### Example 2: Internal Admin Dashboard
**Context**: An internal administrative dashboard, also an SPA, needs to access sensitive company data through a set of internal APIs.
**Challenge**: Ensure the API is completely inaccessible from the public internet and only accessible by employees connected to the corporate network.
**Solution**:
1.  **Network Isolation**: The API Gateway was configured as a `Private` endpoint.
2.  **VPC Endpoint**: A VPC endpoint for `execute-api` was created in the corporate VPC.
3.  **Resource Policy**: A resource policy was attached to the API Gateway, explicitly denying all traffic that did not originate from the VPC endpoint.
4.  **Authentication**: For an additional layer of security, the API methods were configured to use `AWS_IAM` authorization, requiring all requests to be signed with valid IAM credentials, which employees receive when assuming a role via the corporate VPN.
**Outcome**: The API is completely isolated from the public internet, significantly reducing its attack surface. Access is strictly controlled by network location and IAM permissions.
**Technologies**: API Gateway (Private Endpoint), VPC Endpoints, IAM Resource Policies, AWS Direct Connect.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Insecure CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `'*'` for convenience, which allows any website to make requests to your API from a browser.
**Why it happens**: It's the quickest way to fix CORS errors during development.
**Solution**: Configure CORS in API Gateway to only allow specific, trusted origins (e.g., `https://www.my-app.com`). For dynamic environments, use a Lambda authorizer or backend logic to validate the `Origin` header against a whitelist.
**Prevention**: Educate developers on the security risks of wildcard CORS origins and include secure CORS configuration in CI/CD pipeline checks.

### Pitfall 2: Storing Secrets in the Frontend
**Problem**: Embedding API keys or other secrets directly in the JavaScript code of an SPA.
**Why it happens**: A misunderstanding of how to securely call protected APIs from the client-side.
**Solution**: Never store secrets in client-side code. Instead, use a token-based authentication flow (like OIDC with Cognito). The application authenticates the user, receives a short-lived token, and uses that token to call the API. The token, not a permanent secret, is what grants access.
**Prevention**: Code scanners that look for hardcoded secrets. Architectural reviews that enforce a token-based pattern.

## Follow-up Questions Preparation

### Likely Deep-Dive Questions
1.  **"How would you handle authorization based on user roles or attributes with a Cognito authorizer?"**
    - You can inspect the JWT claims passed by Cognito to the backend service. The token contains user attributes and group memberships, which the backend logic can use to make fine-grained authorization decisions.
2.  **"When would you choose a Lambda authorizer over a built-in Cognito authorizer?"**
    - When you need to integrate with a non-Cognito OIDC provider, use an OAuth2-introspection endpoint, or implement highly custom logic, like checking permissions from an external database.
3.  **"How can you protect the backend services (e.g., Lambda) from being invoked by anything other than your configured API Gateway?"**
    - Use Lambda resource-based policies (also known as Lambda permissions) to specify the ARN of the API Gateway execution endpoint as the only principal allowed to invoke the function.

## Sample Answer Framework

### Opening Statement
"Securing API Gateway endpoints for a frontend application requires a defense-in-depth strategy. My approach involves layering security controls, starting at the edge with AWS WAF, then handling authentication and authorization at the request level with a service like Amazon Cognito, and finally applying network-level controls with resource policies where necessary."

### Core Answer Structure
1.  **First Layer (WAF)**: Explain that the first step is to filter malicious traffic using AWS WAF with managed and custom rules.
2.  **Second Layer (Authentication)**: Describe using Amazon Cognito as the primary method for user authentication, explaining how the frontend gets a JWT to present to the API.
3.  **Third Layer (Authorization)**: Detail how the API Gateway's Cognito authorizer validates the JWT, ensuring only valid, authenticated requests proceed.
4.  **Additional Layers**: Briefly mention secure CORS configuration and the option for private APIs using resource policies for stricter security contexts.

### Closing Statement
"This layered approach ensures that the API is protected from a wide range of threats, from automated bots and web exploits to unauthorized access, while leveraging managed AWS services to provide a scalable and maintainable security posture."

## Technical Deep-Dive Points

### Implementation Details

**Terraform for API Gateway with Cognito Authorizer:**
```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_authorizer" "cognito_auth" {
  name                   = "cognito_user_pool_authorizer"
  rest_api_id            = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.my_api.id
  type                   = "COGNITO_USER_POOLS"
  identity_source        = "method.request.header.Authorization"
  provider_arns          = [aws_cognito_user_pool.my_pool.arn]
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "my_method" {
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.my_api.id
  resource_id   = aws_api_gateway_resource.my_resource.id
  http_method   = "GET"
  authorization = "COGNITO_USER_POOLS"
  authorizer_id = aws_api_gateway_authorizer.cognito_auth.id
}
```

**Secure CORS Configuration in API Gateway (Console View):**
- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: `'GET,OPTIONS,POST,PUT'`
- **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**: `'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'`
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: `'https://your.frontend.domain.com'` (Never `'*'` in production)

### Metrics and Measurement
- **WAF Metrics**: Monitor `BlockedRequests` and `AllowedRequests` in CloudWatch to tune rules.
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Track `4XXError` rates to detect authorization problems and `5XXError` rates for backend issues. Use `Latency` metrics to measure the performance impact of authorizers.
- **Cognito Logs**: Monitor sign-in attempts and failures for signs of brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
